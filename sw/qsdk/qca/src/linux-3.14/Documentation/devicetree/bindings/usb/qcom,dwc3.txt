QCOM DWC3 Highspeed USB PHY
========================
Required properities:
- compatible:	should contain "qcom,dwc3-hsphy";
- reg:			offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- clocks:		A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
				clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  "utmi"		UTMI clock
- v1p8-supply:	phandle to the regulator for the 1.8v supply to HSPHY.
- v3p3-supply:	phandle to the regulator for the 3.3v supply to HSPHY.
- vbus-supply:	phandle to the regulator for the vbus supply for host
		mode.

QCOM DWC3 controller wrapper
===========================
Required properties:
- compatible:	should contain "qcom,dwc3"
- clocks:		A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
				clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  "core"		Master/Core clock, have to be >= 125 MHz for SS
				operation and >= 60MHz for HS operation

Optional clocks:
  "iface"		System bus AXI clock.  Not present on all platforms
  "sleep"		Sleep clock, used when USB3 core goes into low
				power mode (U3).

Optional regulator:
- gdsc-supply:	phandle to the regulator from globally distributed
				switch controller

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Example device nodes:

		hs_phy_0: phy@110f8800 {
			compatible = "qcom,dwc3-hsphy";
			reg = <0x110f8800 0x30>;
			clocks = <&gcc USB30_0_UTMI_CLK>;
			clock-names = "utmi";

			status = "disabled";
		};

		ss_phy_0: phy@110f8830 {
			compatible = "qcom,dwc3-ssphy";
			reg = <0x110f8830 0x30>;

			clocks = <&gcc USB30_0_MASTER_CLK>;
			clock-names = "ref";

			status = "disabled";
		};

		usb3_0: usb30@0 {
			compatible = "qcom,dwc3";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&gcc USB30_0_MASTER_CLK>;
			clock-names = "core";

			ranges;

			status = "disabled";

			dwc3@11000000 {
