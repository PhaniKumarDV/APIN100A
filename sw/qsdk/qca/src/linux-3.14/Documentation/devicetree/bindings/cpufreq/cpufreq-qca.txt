qca,ipq40xx cpufreq driver
-------------------

IPQ40xx SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.

Required properties:
- operating-points: Table of frequencies and voltage CPU could be transitioned into,
	in the decreasing order. Frequency should be in KHz units and voltage
	should be in microvolts.

Optional properties:
- clock-latency: Clock monitor latency in microsecond. Example: 200usec

All the required listed above must be defined under node cpufreq.

Example:
--------
	cpu_freq_ipq40xx {
		compatible = "qca,ipq40xx_freq";
		clock-latency = <0x100>;
	};
