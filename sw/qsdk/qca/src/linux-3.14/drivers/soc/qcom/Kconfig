config QCOM_GSBI
        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_SCM
        bool

config QCOM_TCSR
        tristate "QCOM Top Control and Status Registers"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable TCSR support.  The TCSR provides control
          functions for various peripherals.

config QCOM_RESTART_REASON
        bool "Write restart reason on reboot"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable writing restart reason. This adds a reboot handler
          to write the restart reason command to distinguish between normal and
          abnormal reboots. This also registers for panic notification so that
          magic cookies can be set for download mode.
          If unsure, say N

config QCA_SCM_RESTART_REASON
        bool "Write restart reason on reboot"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable writing scm restart reason. This adds a reboot
          handler to invoke trusted software to disable software debug and
          magic cookie. This also registers for panic notification so that
          magic cookies can be set for download mode.
          If unsure, say N


config QCOM_DLOAD_MODE
        bool "Enable download mode on crashes"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        default n
        help
          This makes the SoC enter download mode when it resets
          due to a kernel panic. Note that this doesn't by itself
          make the kernel reboot on a kernel panic - that must be
          enabled via another mechanism.
          If unsure, say N

config QCOM_DLOAD_MODE_APPSBL
        bool "Application bootloader based download mode handling"
        depends on QCOM_DLOAD_MODE
        default n
        help
          Select this if application bootloader, for example U-Boot, will handle
          download mode due to kernel panic.

config QCOM_CACHE_DUMP
        bool "QCOM cache dumping support"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable cache dumping support. This adds infrastructure
          to dump the L1 and L2 caches to an allocated buffer. This allows for
          analysis of the caches in case cache corruption is suspected.
          If unsure, say N

config QCOM_CACHE_DUMP_ON_PANIC
        bool "Dump caches on panic"
        depends on QCOM_CACHE_DUMP
        help
          By default, the caches are flushed on panic. This means that trying to
          look at them in a RAM dump will give useless data. Select this if you
          want to dump the L1 and L2 caches on panic before any flush occurs.
          If unsure, say N

config QCOM_TZ_LOG
	tristate "Trust Zone (TZ) Log Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option enables a driver with a debugfs interface for messages
	  produced by the Secure code (Trust zone). These messages provide
	  diagnostic information about TZ operation.
