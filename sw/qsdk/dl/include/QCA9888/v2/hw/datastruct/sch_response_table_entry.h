ps_poll_response_ptr
			
			This field can only be evaluated when the

			describing the response handling details to receiving the
			PS_POLL frame.
			
			
			
			When NULL, there is no response defined, and no SIFS
			response will be generated. <legal all>

u_apsd_response_ptr
			
			This field can only be evaluated when the
			SCH_RX_FRAME_INFO TLV indicates a QoS Data frame has been
			received AND the STA power state (also indicated in this
			TLV) is set to power save.
			
			 
			
			This field is a pointer to UAPSD_RESPONSE TLV describing
			the response handling to receiving a potential U_APSD
			trigger.
			
			
			
			When NULL, there is no response defined, and no SIFS
			response will be generated. <legal all>

qboost_response_ptr
			
			This field can only be evaluated when the
			SCH_RX_FRAME_INFO TLV indicates a QoS Data frame has been
			received AND the STA power state (also indicated in this
			TLV) is NOT in power save.
			
			This field is a pointer to a QBOOST_RESPONSE  TLV
			describing the response to receiving a potential Qboost
			trigger.
