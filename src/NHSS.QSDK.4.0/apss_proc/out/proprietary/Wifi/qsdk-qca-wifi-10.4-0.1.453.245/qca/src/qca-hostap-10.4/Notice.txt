wpa_supplicant and hostapd
--------------------------

Copyright (c) 2002-2012, Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi> and contributors
All Rights Reserved.

These programs are licensed under the BSD license (the one with
advertisement clause removed).

If you are submitting changes to the project, please see CONTRIBUTIONS
file for more instructions.


This package may include either wpa_supplicant, hostapd, or both. See
README file respective subdirectories (wpa_supplicant/README or
hostapd/README) for more details.

Source code files were moved around in v0.6.x releases and compared to
earlier releases, the programs are now built by first going to a
subdirectory (wpa_supplicant or hostapd) and creating build
configuration (.config) and running 'make' there (for Linux/BSD/cygwin
builds).

 * HLR/AuC testing gateway for hostapd EAP-SIM/AKA database/authenticator
 * Copyright (c) 2005-2007, 2012-2013, Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi>
 *
 * This software may be distributed under the terms of the BSD license.
 * See README for more details.
 *
 * This is an example implementation of the EAP-SIM/AKA database/authentication
 * gateway interface to HLR/AuC. It is expected to be replaced with an
 * implementation of SS7 gateway to GSM/UMTS authentication center (HLR/AuC) or
 * a local implementation of SIM triplet and AKA authentication data generator.
 *
 * hostapd will send SIM/AKA authentication queries over a UNIX domain socket
 * to and external program, e.g., this hlr_auc_gw. This interface uses simple
 * text-based format:
 *
 * EAP-SIM / GSM triplet query/response:
 * SIM-REQ-AUTH <IMSI> <max_chal>
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> Kc1:SRES1:RAND1 Kc2:SRES2:RAND2 [Kc3:SRES3:RAND3]
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 * GSM-AUTH-REQ <IMSI> RAND1:RAND2[:RAND3]
 * GSM-AUTH-RESP <IMSI> Kc1:SRES1:Kc2:SRES2[:Kc3:SRES3]
 * GSM-AUTH-RESP <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS query/response:
 * AKA-REQ-AUTH <IMSI>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> <RAND> <AUTN> <IK> <CK> <RES>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS AUTS (re-synchronization):
 * AKA-AUTS <IMSI> <AUTS> <RAND>
 *
 * IMSI and max_chal are sent as an ASCII string,
 * Kc/SRES/RAND/AUTN/IK/CK/RES/AUTS as hex strings.
 *
 * An example implementation here reads GSM authentication triplets from a
 * text file in IMSI:Kc:SRES:RAND format, IMSI in ASCII, other fields as hex
 * strings. This is used to simulate an HLR/AuC. As such, it is not very useful
 * for real life authentication, but it is useful both as an example
 * implementation and for EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA' testing.
 *
 * For a stronger example design, Milenage and GSM-Milenage algorithms can be
 * used to dynamically generate authenticatipn information for EAP-AKA/AKA' and
 * EAP-SIM, respectively, if Ki is known.
 *
 * SQN generation follows the not time-based Profile 2 described in
 * 3GPP TS 33.102 Annex C.3.2. The length of IND is 5 bits by default, but this
 * can be changed with a command line options if needed.

 * HLR/AuC testing gateway for hostapd EAP-SIM/AKA database/authenticator

 *
 * This software may be distributed under the terms of the BSD license.

 *
 * This is an example implementation of the EAP-SIM/AKA database/authentication
 * gateway interface to HLR/AuC. It is expected to be replaced with an
 * implementation of SS7 gateway to GSM/UMTS authentication center (HLR/AuC) or
 * a local implementation of SIM triplet and AKA authentication data generator.
 *
 * hostapd will send SIM/AKA authentication queries over a UNIX domain socket
 * to and external program, e.g., this hlr_auc_gw. This interface uses simple
 * text-based format:
 *
 * EAP-SIM / GSM triplet query/response:
 * SIM-REQ-AUTH <IMSI> <max_chal>
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> Kc1:SRES1:RAND1 Kc2:SRES2:RAND2 [Kc3:SRES3:RAND3]
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 * GSM-AUTH-REQ <IMSI> RAND1:RAND2[:RAND3]
 * GSM-AUTH-RESP <IMSI> Kc1:SRES1:Kc2:SRES2[:Kc3:SRES3]
 * GSM-AUTH-RESP <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS query/response:
 * AKA-REQ-AUTH <IMSI>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> <RAND> <AUTN> <IK> <CK> <RES>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS AUTS (re-synchronization):
 * AKA-AUTS <IMSI> <AUTS> <RAND>
 *
 * IMSI and max_chal are sent as an ASCII string,
 * Kc/SRES/RAND/AUTN/IK/CK/RES/AUTS as hex strings.
 *
 * An example implementation here reads GSM authentication triplets from a
 * text file in IMSI:Kc:SRES:RAND format, IMSI in ASCII, other fields as hex
 * strings. This is used to simulate an HLR/AuC. As such, it is not very useful
 * for real life authentication, but it is useful both as an example
 * implementation and for EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA' testing.
 *
 * For a stronger example design, Milenage and GSM-Milenage algorithms can be
 * used to dynamically generate authenticatipn information for EAP-AKA/AKA' and
 * EAP-SIM, respectively, if Ki is known.
 *
 * SQN generation follows the not time-based Profile 2 described in
 * 3GPP TS 33.102 Annex C.3.2. The length of IND is 5 bits by default, but this
 * can be changed with a command line options if needed.

 * generation. The os_get_random() output is expected to be secure and the
 * implementation here is expected to provide only limited protection against
 * cases where os_get_random() cannot provide strong randomness. This
 * implementation shall not be assumed to be secure as the sole source of
 * randomness. The random_get_bytes() function mixes in randomness from
 * os_get_random() and as such, calls to os_get_random() can be replaced with
 * calls to random_get_bytes() without reducing security.
 *
 * The design here follows partially the design used in the Linux
 * drivers/char/random.c, but the implementation here is simpler and not as
 * strong. This is a compromise to reduce duplicated CPU effort and to avoid
 * extra code/memory size. As pointed out above, os_get_random() needs to be
 * guaranteed to be secure for any of the security assumptions to hold.

 * See README for more details.
 *
 * This l2_packet implementation is explicitly for WinPcap and Windows events.
 * l2_packet_pcap.c has support for WinPcap, but it requires polling to receive
 * frames which means relatively long latency for EAPOL RX processing. The
 * implementation here uses a separate thread to allow WinPcap to be receiving
 * all the time to reduce latency for EAPOL receiving from about 100 ms to 3 ms
 * when comparing l2_packet_pcap.c to l2_packet_winpcap.c. Extra sleep of 50 ms
 * is added in to receive thread whenever no EAPOL frames has been received for
 * a while. Whenever an EAPOL handshake is expected, this sleep is removed.
 *
 * The RX thread receives a frame and signals main thread through Windows event
 * about the availability of a new frame. Processing the received frame is
 * synchronized with pair of Windows events so that no extra buffer or queuing
 * mechanism is needed. This implementation requires Windows specific event
 * loop implementation, i.e., eloop_win.c.
 *
 * WinPcap has pcap_getevent() that could, in theory at least, be used to
 * implement this kind of waiting with a simpler single-thread design. However,
 * that event handle is not really signaled immediately when receiving each
 * frame, so it does not really work for this kind of use.

 * httpread - Manage reading file(s) from HTTP/TCP socket
 * Author: Ted Merrill

 *
 * This software may be distributed under the terms of the BSD license.
 * See README for more details.
 *
 * The files are buffered via internal callbacks from eloop, then presented to
 * an application callback routine when completely read into memory. May also
 * be used if no file is expected but just to get the header, including HTTP
 * replies (e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK etc.).
 *
 * This does not attempt to be an optimally efficient implementation, but does
 * attempt to be of reasonably small size and memory consumption; assuming that
 * only small files are to be read. A maximum file size is provided by
 * application and enforced.
 *
 * It is assumed that the application does not expect any of the following:
 * -- transfer encoding other than chunked
 * -- trailer fields
 * It is assumed that, even if the other side requested that the connection be
 * kept open, that we will close it (thus HTTP messages sent by application
 * should have the connection closed field); this is allowed by HTTP/1.1 and
 * simplifies things for us.
 *
 * Other limitations:
 * -- HTTP header may not exceed a hard-coded size.
 *
 * Notes:
 * This code would be massively simpler without some of the new features of
 * HTTP/1.1, especially chunked data.
