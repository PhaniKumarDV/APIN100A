/**
 * @brief Indicate when a paused STA has tx data available.
 * @details
 *  Indicate to the control SW when a paused peer that previously
 *  has all its peer-TID queues empty gets a MSDU to transmit.
 *  Conversely, indicate when a paused peer that had data in one or more of
 *  its peer-TID queues has all queued data removed (e.g. due to a U-APSD
 *  triggered transmission), but is still paused.
 *  It is up to the control SW to determine whether the peer is paused due to
 *  being in power-save sleep, or some other reason, and thus whether it is
 *  necessary to set the TIM in beacons to notify a sleeping STA that it has
 *  data.
 *  The data SW will also issue this ol_tx_paused_peer_data call when an
 *  unpaused peer that currently has tx data in one or more of its
 *  peer-TID queues becomes paused.
 *  The data SW will not issue this ol_tx_paused_peer_data call when a
 *  peer with data in one or more of its peer-TID queues becomes unpaused.

 * @param peer - the paused peer
 * @param has_tx_data -
 *      1 -> a paused peer that previously had no tx data now does, -OR-
 *      0 -> a paused peer that previously had tx data now doesnt
