Open source code.Contributions to hostap.git
---------------------------

This software is distributed under a permissive open source license to
allow it to be used in any projects, whether open source or proprietary.
Contributions to the project are welcome and it is important to maintain
clear record of contributions and terms under which they are licensed.
To help with this, following procedure is used to allow acceptance and
recording of the terms.

These terms are similar to the process used in Linux kernel development.
The items (a) through (d) are identical to the Developer's Certificate
of Origin 1.1. To enable cleaner licensing option to be provided in the
future, an additional item (e) is included.

Until February 11, 2012, in case of most files in hostap.git, ""under the
open source license indicated in the file"" means that the contribution
is licensed both under GPL v2 and modified BSD license (see below) and
the choice between these licenses is given to anyone who redistributes
or uses the software. As such, the contribution has to be licensed under
both options to allow this choice.

As of February 11, 2012, the project has chosen to use only the BSD
license option for future distribution. As such, the GPL v2 license
option is no longer used and the contributions are not required to be
licensed until GPL v2. In case of most files in hostap.git, ""under the
open source license indicated in the file"" means that the contribution
is licensed under the modified BSD license (see below).


The additional item (e) is used to collect explicit approval to license
the contribution with only the modified BSD license (see below), i.e.,
without the GPL v2 option. This was done to allow simpler licensing
terms to be used in the future. It should be noted that the modified BSD
license is compatible with GNU GPL and as such, this possible move to
simpler licensing option does not prevent use of this software in
GPL projects.


By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

Additionally, I certify that:

(e) The contribution can be licensed under the modified BSD license
    as shown below even in case of files that are currently licensed
    under other terms.


To indicate your acceptance of these terms, please add the following
line to each contribution you make to the project:

Signed-hostap: Your Name <your@email.example.org>

using your real name. Pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot
unfortunately be accepted.
